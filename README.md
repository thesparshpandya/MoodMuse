# 🧠 MoodMuse — AI‑First Journaling Companion

MoodMuse is a warm, emotionally intelligent journaling web app powered by AI. It lets users share their feelings and receive **honest, supportive reflections**—like a wise friend who listens, comforts, and isn’t afraid to call you out gently.

---

## 🚧 Status: Work in Progress

This is a **live experiment**, built AI-first using tools like **Lovable.dev**. Rather than hand-coding every line, I'm focusing on:
- Designing the architecture, UX, and emotional tone  
- Crafting prompts that create meaningful, balanced reflections  
- Exploring how far AI tools can help build complete apps

This journey is less about writing code and more about **building with AI**, shaping emotionally aware software.

## ✨ Core Features (WIP)

- 🌈 **Mood Selector** — choose how you feel  
- 📝 **Journal Entry** — open-ended emotional writing  
- 🤖 **AI Reflections** — 2–6 sentences of empathic insight  
- 🔐 **API Key Setup** — securely stored in browser  
- 📚 **Reflection History** — revisit past thoughts

## 🧠 Philosophy

> MoodMuse doesn’t just tell you what you want to hear—it reflects what you *need*, with compassion and clarity.  
> It’s not therapy, it’s honest self-reflection guided by a caring AI friend.
